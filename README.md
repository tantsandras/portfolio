# Sandra Grahl - Portfolio :computer:

Live at: https://sandragrahl.netlify.com/

Why, you ask?

Why indeed, I say. Does anyone actually look at a Junior Devs portfolios when they have github? Only time will tell.
But I guess it's a way to showcase some of my projects (and also a way to try out Next.js <-- might be the real reason, who knows). 

## Built with :hammer:

- Next.js :heavy_check_mark:

## What I learnt :eyeglasses:

- How to make css animations with styled components 
- How to use Next.js 
- How to deploy a Next.js site on Netlify 
- That writing project descriptions is hard 

## Issues I had :crying_cat_face:

- My mp4 videos that play on hover won't play on mobile. Gosh darn it
